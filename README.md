## Description
The C++ Pool of Exercises is a comprehensive collection of exercises designed to introduce learners to the world of the C++ language and the features of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The pool is structured into different modules, with each module focusing on a specific concept in C++ and OOP. By completing these exercises, learners will gain hands-on experience and a deeper understanding of various topics in C++ programming and OOP principles.

## The Pool Modules

The pool consists of the following modules:
1. **Module 00 - Namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists, static, const, and some other basic stuff**: This module covers the fundamentals of C++ programming, including namespaces, classes, member functions, streams, and more.

2. **Module 01 - Memory allocation, pointers to members, references, switch statement**: Module 01 explores memory allocation, pointers to members, references, and the switch statement in C++.

3. **Module 02 - Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading, and Orthodox Canonical class form**: This module delves into ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading, and the Orthodox Canonical class form.

4. **Module 03 - Inheritance**: Module 03 focuses on inheritance in C++, covering topics such as base classes, derived classes, and inheritance hierarchies.

5. **Module 04 - Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces**: This module introduces subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfaces in C++.

6. **Module 05 - Repetition and Exceptions**: Module 05 explores repetition structures and exception handling in C++.

7. **Module 06 - C++ casts**: This module covers different types of casts in C++, including static_cast, dynamic_cast, reinterpret_cast, and const_cast.

8. **Module 07 - C++ templates**: Module 07 focuses on C++ templates, including template functions and classes.

9. **Module 08 - Templated containers, iterators, algorithms**: This module delves into templated containers, iterators, and algorithms in C++.

10. **Module 09 - STL**: The final module, Module 09, covers the Standard Template Library (STL) in C++, including various containers, algorithms, and iterators provided by the STL.
