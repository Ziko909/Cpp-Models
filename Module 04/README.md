## Description
Module 04 focuses on subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfaces in C++. In this module, you will learn about the following topics:

- Subtype polymorphism: Understanding the concept of polymorphism and its application in C++.
- Abstract classes: Creating abstract classes and using them as base classes for derived classes.
- Interfaces: Implementing interfaces in C++ and utilizing them in class inheritance.

The module consists of several exercises that will help you practice and reinforce your understanding of these concepts. You will be required to implement classes, override functions, and demonstrate the principles of subtype polymorphism.

## Helpful Resources
Here are some helpful resources specifically related to the concepts covered in this module:

- [Polymorphism in C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science)): This resource provides an explanation of polymorphism in C++ and how it enables objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common base type.

- [Abstract Classes and Pure Virtual Functions](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pure-virtual-functions-and-abstract-classes-in-cpp/): This tutorial explains abstract classes and pure virtual functions in C++ and how they can be used to create interfaces and enforce class hierarchies.

- [Interfaces and Multiple Inheritance](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/interfaces-in-c-sharp-need-explanation/): This resource discusses interfaces in C++ and their role in multiple inheritance scenarios. It provides examples and explanations of how interfaces are implemented and utilized.

These resources provide specific explanations and examples related to the concepts covered in this module. They can serve as references to deepen your understanding and clarify any doubts you may have.
