## Description

Module 00 is the introductory module for learning C++. In this module, you will cover the following topics:

- Namespaces
- Classes
- Member Functions
- stdio Streams
- Initialization Lists
- Static and Const
- Basic Concepts

The purpose of this module is to introduce you to the basics of C++ programming and familiarize you with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. C++ is a powerful programming language derived from the C programming language, and it offers additional features and capabilities for building complex applications.

Throughout the module, you will work on exercises that gradually increase in complexity. These exercises will help you practice and reinforce your understanding of the covered topics.
