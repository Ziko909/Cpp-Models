## Description
Module 03 is part of the C++ modules and focuses on the topic of inheritance. Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows classes to inherit properties and behavior from other classes.

This module contains exercises that will guide you through implementing and understanding inheritance in C++. You will learn how to create derived classes that inherit constructors and destructors from base classes. You will also explore the use of virtual functions and polymorphism.

The exercises in this module will help you practice and reinforce your understanding of inheritance and its various aspects. By completing these exercises, you will gain hands-on experience in utilizing inheritance to build more complex and specialized classes in your C++ programs.
