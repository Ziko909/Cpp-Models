## Description
Module 02 is a comprehensive module that covers various topics in C++ programming, including ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading, and Orthodox Canonical class form.

The module starts with an introduction to ad-hoc polymorphism, which allows functions to behave differently depending on the types of arguments they receive. It explores the concept of operator overloading, which enables the definition of custom behaviors for operators in user-defined classes.

The module also emphasizes the importance of adhering to the Orthodox Canonical class form, a design pattern that promotes consistency and maintainability in class implementations. It covers the principles and guidelines for designing classes in this form.

Throughout the module, you will work on exercises that apply the concepts learned. These exercises are carefully designed to gradually increase in complexity, allowing you to practice and reinforce your understanding of ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading, and the Orthodox Canonical class form.

By the end of this module, you will have a solid understanding of these important concepts in C++ programming. You will be able to apply them effectively in your own code, enhancing the flexibility, readability, and reusability of your programs.
