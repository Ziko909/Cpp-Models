## Description
Module 09 is a module that focuses on the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). In this module, you will learn about the various containers and algorithms provided by the STL and how to effectively utilize them in your C++ programs.

The module covers the following topics:
- Introduction to the C++ STL
- General rules for using the STL
- Module-specific rules for using the STL
- Exercises that involve implementing classes using the STL containers

The goal of this module is to introduce you to the power and versatility of the C++ STL. By understanding and utilizing the STL, you can write more efficient and maintainable code by leveraging the pre-built containers and algorithms provided by the library.

Throughout the module, you will have the opportunity to work on exercises that involve using the STL containers and algorithms to solve specific problems. These exercises are designed to help you practice and reinforce your knowledge of the STL in the context of C++ programming.
