## Description
Module 08 is focused on templated containers, iterators, and algorithms in C++ programming. In this module, you will learn about the usage of templated containers, how to work with iterators to traverse and manipulate container elements, and how to leverage algorithms provided by the C++ Standard Library.

The module covers the following topics:
- Templated containers in C++
- Working with iterators
- Using algorithms from the C++ Standard Library

By understanding these concepts and techniques, you will be able to create flexible and reusable code that can work with different data types and efficiently perform various operations on container elements.

Throughout the module, you will have the opportunity to work on exercises that involve implementing templated containers, working with iterators to access and modify container elements, and utilizing algorithms to perform common tasks on containers. These exercises will help you practice and reinforce your understanding of these important concepts in C++ programming.

## Helpful Resources
Here are some resources that can be helpful for further understanding of the topics covered in this module:

- [C++ Reference - Containers](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container) - Comprehensive documentation on C++ containers, including vector, list, map, and more.
- [C++ Reference - Iterators](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/iterator) - Detailed explanations of C++ iterators and their usage in traversing and manipulating container elements.
- [C++ Reference - Algorithms](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm) - Extensive information on C++ algorithms provided by the C++ Standard Library, such as sorting, searching, and modifying container elements.

These resources will help you deepen your understanding of templated containers, iterators, and algorithms in C++ programming. It is recommended to refer to them as you work through the exercises and further explore the world of flexible and efficient data manipulation in C++.
